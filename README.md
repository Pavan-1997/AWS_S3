# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

S3 is like a virtual drive to store and retrieve data. According to the AWS definition, â€œYou can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web."

```
- Files in S3 are stored in buckets ( Buckets are like folders )
- S3 is object-based storage (Like Images, videos, documents etc)
- Buckets names should be unique globally because when we create a bucket in S3 it will have a unique URL.
- Its a good practice create buckets in the nearest region to you or for your customers.
```

The five majoor advantages of S3:

- Availability & Durability
- Scalability
- Security
- Cost Effective
- Performance

```
- S3 provides bucket policies, access control, and encryption settings that are appropriately configured. 
- Encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption options provided by S3. Additionally, enable encryption in transit by using SSL/TLS for data transfers. 
- Enable access logging to capture detailed records of requests made to your S3 bucket. 
- Monitor access logs and configure alerts to detect any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts. 
- S3 provides features and configurations to assist with compliance requirements, such as enabling Object Lock for data immutability, managing legal holds, and integrating with AWS CloudTraiI for audit trails.
