# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

S3 is like a virtual drive to store and retrieve data. According to the AWS definition, â€œYou can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web."

```
- Files in S3 are stored in buckets ( Buckets are like folders )
- S3 is object-based storage (Like Images, videos, documents etc)
- Buckets names should be unique globally because when we create a bucket in S3 it will have a unique URL.
- Its a good practice create buckets in the nearest region to you or for your customers.
```
